# or
pnpm install
```
---

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Google Gemini API
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret

```
---

### Key Directories

- **`src/app/`**: Page routes and layouts
- **`src/components/`**: UI components organized by feature
- **`src/contexts/`**: Global state management (Auth, XP, Theme)
- **`src/lib/`**: Firebase config, data files, utilities

---

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React Guidelines

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **ES6+** syntax
- Use **async/await** instead of promises where possible
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use **PropTypes** or **TypeScript** for type checking

---

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.jsx` (e.g., `UserProfile.jsx`)
- Utilities: `camelCase.js` (e.g., `formatDate.js`)
- Hooks: `useCamelCase.js` (e.g., `useAuth.js`)
- Context: `camelCase.jsx` (e.g., `auth.jsx`)

---

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings
- **Semicolons**: Optional but consistent
- **Line length**: Max 100 characters
- **Comments**: Use JSDoc for functions

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate user's XP progress percentage
 * @param {number} currentXP - User's current XP
 * @param {number} requiredXP - XP needed for next level
 * @returns {number} Progress percentage (0-100)
 */
function calculateProgress(currentXP, requiredXP) {
  return Math.min((currentXP / requiredXP) * 100, 100);
}
```
---

### React Best Practices

```jsx
// ✅ Good
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function MyComponent({ title, onClose }) {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>{title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

// ❌ Avoid
function mycomponent(props) {
  var isOpen = false;
  return <div><h1>{props.title}</h1></div>
}
```
---

### Styling

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- Use `className` for conditional styling
- Keep custom CSS minimal
- Follow mobile-first responsive design

```jsx
// ✅ Good
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Title</h2>
</div>
```
---

- No period at the end of subject
- Separate subject from body with blank line
